# Order Service

The Order Service provides a set of APIs for stock trading. It offers endpoints for buying or selling stocks and getting the details of the existing stock trading transactions.

## Endpoints

- `POST /api/order`: Perform stock trading.
- `GET /api/order/{id}`: Retrieves details of a trading transaction by its ID.

## Running the Service

This service is containerized and intended to be run as part of the overall project using Docker Compose. Refer to the main project README for instructions on how to run the entire suite of services.
